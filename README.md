# TOTK-Text-Game-Demo
My word game that's heavily based off of Tears of the Kingdom but with a lot of creative changes. (Game Prog 1 exercise)

/--------------------------------/

Hi! If you're reading this and are actually curious about it, this is my first hand experience with unity and game programming. It took quite some time for me to get back and polish this but overall, I'm quite happy with how it turned out! I'll most likely create more of these in the future but with their own plots and UI designs. For now, I hope you enjoy this!

/--------------------------------/

I'd say there are a total of around 4-6 routes (I am honestly not sure if I could count the others) but there are only two endings, just depends on how you get there like how you play Breath of the Wild.

I own no rights to any references made as well as any copywrite material indicated in the game. All I own is the dialogues and script.
